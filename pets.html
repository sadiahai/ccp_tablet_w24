            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" class="center" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different
                beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as
                he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to
                admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
                energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
                ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <h2>Juno</h2>
            <img src="images/juno_profile.JPG" class="center" alt="Black and brown dog asleep on his side">

            <p>No one knows exactly what breed Juno is, but that makes him all the more special. He was adopted before
                he was one year old; despite this and his German shepherd-esque looks, he stayed close to the same size,
                hovering around 50 lbs into adulthood. At the weathered age of ten years old, Juno is dealing with hip
                problems, but manages to stay in good spirits.</p>
            <br>
            <p>One of Juno’s favorite pastimes is finding the dirtiest puddle within a one-mile radius and making sure
                every inch of him makes contact with said puddle. If rolling around in dirt was an Olympic sport, Juno
                would have been the one that facilitated its inclusion into the Olympics.

            <img src="images/rocket_primary.jpg" class="center" alt="Cute, small and yellow pomeranian">

            <p>Rocket (also named huihui) is a 6-month pomeranian puppy with big eyes and a small, black cute nose.
                Rocket is named rocket because he runs so fast and energetic all day without even having some rest.
                Rocket loves to carry his little toy walking around the house and jumping towards my bed.</p>
            <p>Rocket is friendly to all human beings. He will be a little shy at first, but will ‘say hi’ to you after
                a few seconds. He is also friendly to dogs, especially the small breed, because the large size dogs are
                hard for him to smell lol. If you meet rocket, don’t hesitate to say hi to him!! He will be super happy
                the whole day.</p>
